# Idea
* Based on a point array
* Points can be anchors
* Anchors can call some kinds of spreads
* Spreads can be radial or grid based
* Spreads can be based on weights
* Point array eventually becomes a point tree
* Point nodes can be laid out
* Priority nodes
* Priority roads
* Vectorize point vectors with weights and randomness
* Anchor spreads and point node spreads
